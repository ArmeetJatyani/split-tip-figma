# tip-split-figma
A web design I made for a tip splitting app that could be used at restaurants!

## Front-End-Mentor
This web design is a challenge on `frontendmentor.io`!
I recreated the design in Figma, adding a few minor changes, to practice my design skills!
Maybe I'll implement this in the future when I'm learning React!
